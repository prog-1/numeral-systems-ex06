## Exercise #1: Conversion

Find negative values (two's complement) for the given numbers. For each of the
cases please use 8 and 16 bits.

```text
-1     (10) = ? (2)
-7     (10) = ? (2)
-64    (10) = ? (2)
-123   (10) = ? (2)
-128   (10) = ? (2)
```

And the following numbers using only 16 bits (imposible to represent with 8 bits).

```text
-16384 (10) = ? (2)
-32768 (10) = ? (2)
```

## Exercise #2: Operations

Convert base-10 numbers to base-2, calculate the following statements using 8 bits.

```text
-10  (10) + 7  (10) = ? (2)
-100 (10) - 20 (10) = ? (2)
 100 (10) - 20 (10) = ? (2)
 ```
 
 Convert base-10 numbers to base-2, calculate the following statements using 4 bits.
 Please note that resulting value should be encoded with 8 bits. (Optional) Explain why!
 
 ```text
 -1 (10) * -1 (10) = ? (2)
 -4 (10) *  2 (10)  = ? (2)
  4 (10) * -2 (10) = ? (2)
 -4 (10) * -4 (10) = ? (2)
 -8 (10) * -8 (10) = ? (2)
 ```

## Exercise #3 (optional): Conversion base-N (extra 100%)

Represent the following negative numbers in 10- and 16- complements using 4 positions.

```text
-1   (10) = ? (10)
-123 (10) = ? (10)

-1   (16) = ? (16)
-123 (16) = ? (16)
```

Think what are the min values we could represent with 10- and 16- complements using 4 positions.
